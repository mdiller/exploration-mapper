# Exploration Mapper
The idea is to map out an area around my house, and see what roads nearby i haven't yet explored on my bike. Also maybe later I might implement a thing to make a street-view thing with gopro footage.

# Todo

- [x] Figure out strava api and connections
- [x] Get the initial map up and running
- [x] Get the unexplored-roads up and running
- [x] Implement initial streetview stuff
- [x] Integrate the strava stuff into javascript so python script isnt needed anymore
- [ ] Clean up the server code to be a lot better structured with proper await/async stuff
- [ ] Set it up to work on docker
- [ ] Clean up the map and frontend UI
- [ ] Make a thing for the strava auth code thing so its much more streamlined
- [ ] Document stuff well in the readme
- [ ] Make video startable from the streetview preview thing
- [ ] Setup a script to auto-grab the video from gopro and then delete
